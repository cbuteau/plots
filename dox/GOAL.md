
# Goal

## When I learned threading existed in browsers.

I experimented with it heavily.

## What I determined

You should have a system that is aware of each step in the process.

## What I want

What I want in the end is this.

You submit a job module and parameters and the job module is loaded into the thread and executes.

on the client side you get a promise.
you can either then()/catch() it or await+try_catch it.
